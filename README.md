# File Hider in Linux Shell Scripting

The presented study introduces the concept of hiding or unhiding a file using the Bourne-Again Shell (BASH) script in Linux to improve user data security and ensure that the privacy of the user remains secure. In the created system, the user must know the specific directory location of the file and the particular file name to perform the process of hiding or unhiding. The developed project is divided into five parts: menu, hide/unhide feature, listing of hidden files, history, and navigation and selection of files from the directory. Once the BASH script is executed, users will be greeted by the menu that shows the remaining four parts that users can perform.

The project intends to provide an efficient way of concealing a file in hindsight from unauthorized users. It allows only those who are aware of the fileâ€™s existence to unhide it while monitoring the activity logs of each hidden or unhidden file.
